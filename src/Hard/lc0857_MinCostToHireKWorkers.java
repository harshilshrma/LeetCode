// There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i]
// is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
//
//We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers,
// we must pay them according to the following rules:
//
//Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
//In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s
// quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
//Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above
// conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
